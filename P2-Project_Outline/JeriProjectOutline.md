# Project Outline
# Project Back Story

I’m an instructional designer specializing in adult learning.  In October 2018 I was in search of an online learning styles assessment; however, while in “Google mode” I realized there weren’t an abundance of learning styles assessments that I felt fit my specific needs.
Most assessments catered to youth or college age adults rather than an adult learner.  In addition, I found the interfaces to be lacking in corporate professionalism and the questions to lack relevance to the adult learner audience.  
At that moment I thought about creating my own learning styles assessment with the look and functionality that I required.  Although I lacked the knowledge to create the assessment at the time, I thought it would make a good first project that I would be able to create and use soon.  
The learning styles assessment could be utilized by several colleagues throughout my organization and their ongoing feedback would allow me to continue to enhance the assessment.
